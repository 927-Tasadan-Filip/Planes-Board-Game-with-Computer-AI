# Planes-Board-Game-with-Computer-AI
- This project is the classical paper board game "Planes".The game is similar with the "Battleship" game but with a few extra features, such as: instead of line shaped boats we have planes (see the image below) and if the plane head is hit the entire plane is destroyed. The game is played between a human and a computer, which uses an artificial intelligent strategy that simulates the human play style. 
- The game is implemented in Python 3 using Tkinter as a Graphical User Interface software. 
- Below is an image taken from a round of the game.
